# Water Quality Prediction - Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict the **Water Quality Index (WQI)** based on various water parameters. The model analyzes water quality data and applies machine learning techniques to determine the water quality level.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple water quality parameters such as:
- **pH Level**
- **Dissolved Oxygen (DO)**
- **Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)**
- **Nitrate (NO3)**
- **Turbidity**
- **Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)**
- **Conductivity**

## Project Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand trends and relationships in the dataset.
- Preprocess data including handling missing values, scaling, and feature selection.
- Apply **machine learning models** to predict water quality.
- Evaluate model performance using various metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, and R-squared.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- **Data Visualization**
